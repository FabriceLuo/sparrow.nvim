# Sparrow.vim
The vim client of the sparrow service, used to control file synchronization in vim.

# Roadmap
- [ ] Target host selection for synchronization
  - [x] Reuse autossh host configuration, no need to add host configuration manually
  - [x] When the target host is not specified, select in pop-up window
  - [x] When selecting in pop-up window, support preview of target host details
  - [x] When the target host is specified, synchronize and reuse the specified host
  - [x] View the current synchronized target host in floating window
  - [ ] Specify the default synchronization host for the project. After specifying, restart nvim without selecting the target host
  - [x] Re-specify the target host
  - [ ] Perform compatibility check when specifying the target host to ensure the correctness of the target host
  - [ ] Synchronize the host without password/enter the password only once
