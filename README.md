# Sparrow.vim
The vim client of the sparrow service, used to control file synchronization in vim.

# Roadmap
- [ ] Target host selection for synchronization
  - [ ] Reuse autossh host configuration, no need to add host configuration manually
  - [ ] When the target host is not specified, select in pop-up window
  - [ ] When selecting in pop-up window, support preview of target host details
  - [ ] When the target host is specified, synchronize and reuse the specified host
  - [ ] View the current synchronized target host in floating window
  - [ ] Specify the default synchronization host for the project. After specifying, restart nvim without selecting the target host
  - [ ] Re-specify the target host
  - [ ] Perform compatibility check when specifying the target host to ensure the correctness of the target host
  - [ ] Synchronize the host without password/enter the password only once
- [ ] File synchronization
  - [ ] Support configuration of different file transfer tools, such as SCP, RSync, SFTP, etc.
  - [ ] Support multiple version control tools, such as git, subversion, etc.
  - [ ] Project supports multiple synchronization rules
    - [ ] File-level mapping
    - [ ] Directory-level mapping
    - [ ] Automatically generate file mapping based on directory prefix
